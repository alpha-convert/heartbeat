# Heartbeat

Implementing [Heartbeat Scheduling](https://www.chargueraud.org/research/2018/heartbeat/heartbeat.pdf) as a library in OCaml.

So far, this repository only includes the [tree-sum example](lib/tree_sum.ml) from [The best multicore-parallelization refactoring you’ve never heard of](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/mrainey/papers/pardefunc.pdf),
and the [heartbeat-scheduled parallel lambda calculus interpreter](lib/par_lc.ml) from the [original paper](https://www.chargueraud.org/research/2018/heartbeat/heartbeat.pdf).

Built with OCaml version 5.1.0.
