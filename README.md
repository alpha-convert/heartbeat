# Heartbeat

Implementing [Heartbeat Scheduling](https://www.chargueraud.org/research/2018/heartbeat/heartbeat.pdf) as a library in OCaml.

So far, this repository only includes the tree-sum example from [The best multicore-parallelization refactoring youâ€™ve never heard of](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/mrainey/papers/pardefunc.pdf).

Built with OCaml version 5.1.0.
